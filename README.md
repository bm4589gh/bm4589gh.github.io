This peer assessed assignment has two parts. 
First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 
Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

The application has been deployed at this location https://github.com/bm4589gh/DevelopingDataProducts/ui.R and the presentation is at https://github.com/bm4589gh/DevelopingDataProducts/tree/master/slidify/index.html .

When using the app, you will see a histogram of Child Heights.  The Parent Height is selected via the drop down and you will see the values and a red line of the related average Child Height.  You can select different Parent Height and see the Parent and Child values next to the Histogram.
